# neuropath
A neural branch predictor tested using CPU emulator, testing both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (for COS 583: Great Moments in Computing at Princeton University)

# Progress Steps
implement abstract predictor class
implement static predictor
implement simple dynamic
implement gshare (or some more complex dynamic)
implement some result visualizaton
format to trainable data (i.e. for ML/DL)
create NN architecture and train
create visualization of flow through program
implement reinforcement predictor
implement for live system
