# neuropath
A neural branch predictor tested using CPU emulator, testing both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (for COS 583: Great Moments in Computing at Princeton University)

# Progress Steps
<s> 0) preprocess data dumps to be readable/understand </s>
<s> 1) abstract predictor class </s> 
<s> 2) static predictor </s>
<s> 3) simple dynamic </s>
4) gshare (or some more complex dynamic)
5) some result visualizaton
6) format to trainable data (i.e. for ML/DL)
7) create NN architecture and train
8) create visualization of flow through program
9) reinforcement predictor
10) implement for live system (gem5 emulator)
